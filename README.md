<h1>An online Beatmaker to learn javascript</h1>

<p>A live version of the project can be found at this link => <br> https://beat-maker-app-js.netlify.app</p>

<h2>This Beatmaker is the second exercise of Dev Ed's Javasript course and my second Javscript Exercise</h2>

<h3>This 2nd Github repository is a serie of many others that will be published in order to keep track of Javascript progress and practice the basics of git & Github by pushing all projects to a new repository</h3>

<p>My feelings at the end of the project: <br>

  Im getting better with event listeners and constructors.
